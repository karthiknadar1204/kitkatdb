1) first setting the path to persist the vector store in the configs/path.js file
2) The data/vectorStore.json file is the vector store. This file will store the persisted vector data. Initially, it contains an empty vectorData object and wordToIndex object:

```json
{
    "vectorData": {},
    "wordToIndex": {}
}
```

3) vectorData: This object stores the vector embeddings for sentences, not for individual words. 
Each key in vectorData is an identifier (like a sentence ID), and the value is the vector representation of that sentence.

4) wordToIndex: This object maps each unique word in the vocabulary to its corresponding index in the vector.

5) Initial State of vectorData and wordToIndex
Initially:
- vectorData is empty because no sentences or vectors have been added yet.
- wordToIndex is empty because no vocabulary has been created yet.

When the application starts and processes sentences:
- The vocabulary is created, and wordToIndex is populated.
- Sentences are converted to vectors, and these vectors are stored in vectorData.

6) Purpose of vectorStore.json
The vectorStore.json file is used to persist data between runs of the application.
It stores:
- vectorData: All stored sentence vectors.
- wordToIndex: The vocabulary mapping.
This ensures that when the application restarts, it doesnâ€™t need to recreate the vectors or vocabulary. Instead, it can load them directly from the file.

7) Purpose of wordToIndex
It ensures that every word in the vocabulary is associated with a unique position (index) in a vector.
When creating a vector for a sentence, the word's position in the vector corresponds to the index from wordToIndex.

8) Purpose of vectorData
It stores the vector embeddings for sentences. Each key in vectorData is an identifier (like a sentence ID), and the value is the vector representation of that sentence.

9) How vectorData and wordToIndex are used together
- When processing sentences, the vocabulary is created, and wordToIndex is populated.
- Sentences are converted to vectors, and these vectors are stored in vectorData.
- When querying the vector store, the query is converted to a vector, and this vector is compared to all vectors in vectorData using cosine similarity.
- The results are returned in order of similarity, from most similar to least similar.

10) What Does wordToIndex Store?
It stores words as keys and their corresponding indexes as values.

11) Purpose of the VectorStore Class
The VectorStore class is the core part of the application. Its job is to:
- Store sentence vectors (numerical representations of sentences).
- Save and load data to/from a file (vectorStore.json) so it persists across runs.
- Find similar vectors for a given query by comparing them mathematically.



For strict similarity (e.g., finding duplicates):
Look for values close to 1 (e.g., > 0.9).
For broader similarity (e.g., related concepts):
Use a threshold like 0.5 or 0.6.
For weak relationships (e.g., exploratory search):
Consider values above 0.3.
